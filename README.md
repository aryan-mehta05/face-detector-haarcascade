# Face Detection Using The Haarcascade Algorithm

This model uses the pre-trained dataset of face frontals from opencv's dataset catalog. The haarcascade algorithm is then trained on this dataset and thus the model is fit. The program captures real-time video feed from the local webcam of the host system and generates its detection. This code is made to work with both realtime feed as well as work with image uploads; comment and uncomment the code based on the requirement.
